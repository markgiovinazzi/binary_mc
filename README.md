This program crudely estimates the orbital periods and RV slopes of binary stars from the Gaia catalog.

If you use this code, please cite the relevant paper.

To get started, you should clone a copy of the code to your home machine.

```python
git clone https://github.com/markgiovinazzi/binary_mc
cd binary_mc
python3 setup.py sdist
pip3 install dist/binary_mc-1.0.tar.gz
```
